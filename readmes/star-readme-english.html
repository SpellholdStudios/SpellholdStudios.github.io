<p>
	Silver Star is an elven assassin who can join the party in Irenicus' lovely underground hole. This project has recently taken a change of direction in that the original creator Davide Carta decided to throw the mod open to the community. Seizing on this chance, the new team have decided to alter several original elements with a view that is seen as more fitting for Silver Star.

	First of all, a note on the mods content. Even if we had tried to avoid any mild language this mod contains violent or cruel dialogues. Silver Star is an assassin and she acts of like mind doing things like murdering, stealing kidnapping and so on... If you don't like this kind of behaviour simply say to Silver to cease this things and she will stop after some time.<br>
	If you continue to let her be indulge in her psychotic indulgences then she will probably get worse...<br><br>

	Now a note on the status of the mod in relation to BGII itself - Silver Star is not developed, supported, or endorsed by BioWare or Interplay/Black Isle.<br>

	All images and contents of this mod are copyright BioWare, Interplay/Black Isle or Wizards of the Coast.

	This is the list of what we plan to add or what has already been amended. At the time of updating this mod and disposing of the irrelevant matters, I have pushed several of these to the sidelines. Give me enough time and they will be added again.<br>
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Silver Star is a Neutral Evil Assassin compatible with  both SOA &amp; TOB.</li>
	<li>You will find her in the Irenicus Dungeon, city gates or Pocket Plane.</li>
	<li>She is partially insane (we don't want say mad). She has some childhood complex: for example she has a true obsession for sweet little lambs... And She sings and giggles. You know the classic: Mary has a little lamb...</li>
	<li>She is chronically poisoned, this explain her high tolerance to poison and low constitution.</li>
	<li>She is a remorseless killer, when in a normal mood. She does some evil things, like gambling, blackmailing, killing, stealing and so on...</li>
	<li>She has some interaction with NPCs in SoA but not in ToB.</li>

<p><font color="blue" size="+2"><a name="SS4"></a><strong>Section Four - Thanks and Credits</strong></font></p>


<p>Special Thanks to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Davide Carta - For starting the concept and allowing it to be developed without his future guidance. We've done what we can with the mod and hope it honours both what he had in mind and what people may have been expecting of the original.</li>
	<li>Diana - When my own personal life "hit the fan" Diana continued the development and the coding of the mod as my attentions and efforts were elsewhere. She took it upon her herself to fix bugs that I'd missed as well as adding additional material. She also saw fit to beta test on her own before sending the material onto the gang. The mod owes her much.</li>
	<li>Dancer Fitz - One of the mainstays of the team in that she has submitted and written vast amounts of banter, dialogue, ideas and so on for this mod. We also owe her a lot for improving the standard of English vastly from Davide's original version (he was an Italian native). Her own impact cannot be fairly assessed but its all appreciated.</li>
	<li>TGM- for his balancing perspectives and occasional plot suggestions. The number of disagreements and heated exchanges we had in the private
forum vary but his help and insight have always been appreciated.</li>
	<li>St. Jo - For adding her strong, beautiful voice to Silver Star. This was never an easy one to act out but she did it superbly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Neil Sharp for hosting this project and supplying it with both a public and a private forum.</li>
	<li>Westley Weimer for his WeiDU and all the TeamBG programmers for the tools they have made and they continue to make and improve.</li>
	<li>Ryan (ak, Wizard of Thay)for his help in the correction of English and for the long comments to each dialogue and the suggestions for expand this work.</li>
	<li>Erik Manning (Icelus) for discovering how to add the infamous HTML readme file!</li>
	<li>Shar - For commentary, idea submission and bouncing ideas off.</li>
	<li>Efreeti - For also submitting dialogues, comments and ideas, for joining the team at such a late stage.</li>
</ul><br>
