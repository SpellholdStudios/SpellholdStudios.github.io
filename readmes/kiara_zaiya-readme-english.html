		<h2>Overview</h2><br>

		<p>
			This mod introduces two joinable NPCs, Zaiya and Kiara, to your game. Zaiya is a Chaotic Good half-elven wild mage, and Kiara is a Neutral Evil human monk. Zaiya can be found inside the slaver ship (Slums District) and will join your party only if your character is of either good or neutral alignment. This is essential to the game!!! You can't start evil!! Don't cheat, bugs will lurk around if you do!<br>
			Kiara will join the party after you resolve some specific quests AND ZAIYA IS STILL IN YOUR PARTY - AND ALIVE -.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			Zaiya DIES PERMANENTLY if you can't find Kiara in the allocated time (she will tell you more once you find her).
		</p>
		<div style="margin: 10px auto;width: 90%; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: #781808; margin-top: 32px; padding: 6px;">
			<div class="quotetitle">
				<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #781808;">&#x25BA;</span> Advice</strong>:
				<input value="Show" style="color: #e3e3db; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 60px; background:#781808;"
				onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }" type="button" >
			</div>
			<div class="quotecontent">
				<div style="display: none; ">
				<p style="width:96%; color:#5f5f5f;">
					Save often until quest resolved! The battles will be hard if you are at a low level (below 300,000 XP point per party member) but that's the fun about it! Other possibility you come back and pick up Zaiya at a higher level, which means you'll miss on good scenes that have been planted throughout the game or YOU can't find her anymore!
				</p><br>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div><br>

		<p>
			They leave the party for good:
			<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
				<li>if one or the other is killed <em>permanently</em> (out of party - this is not a bug). Though, they won't leave if one is showing dead in the party slot.</li>
				<li>in Brynnlaw if you have not done enough quests around Athklata (this is not a bug). The reason is: it serves the general story.</li>
			</ul>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; <span style="color: #781808;"><strong>ADULT CONTENT:</strong></span> Note that this mod contains some love scenes between the main character and Kiara, and some <em>sex jokes</em>. I would categorize none of these as adult material though it may hurt the sensibility of some of you. If you object to it, DO NOT PLAY THE MOD. &#128521;
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; "/><br>


		<p>
			The mod contains:
		</p>
		<div class="important">
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;">
		  <ul>
			<li>Special abilities for Kiara.</li>
			<li>A special quest.</li>
			<li>A romance and flirts.</li>
			<li>Custom voicing.</li>
			<li style="margin-right:-10%;">Banters with the original Bioware NPCs: Aerie (Zaiya only), Anomen (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Cernd (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Edwin (Kiara only), Haer Dalis (Kiara only), Imoen (Kiara only), Jaheira (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Jan (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Keldorn (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Korgan (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Mazzy (Kiara only), Minsc (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Nalia (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Valygar (Kiara &amp; Zaiya), Viconia (Kiara &amp; Zaiya) and Yoshimo (Kiara only).</li>
			<li style="margin-right:-10%;">Interjections about the player's conversations with non-party NPCs, and interactions with non-party NPCs: Adalon, Anas, Aran Linvail, Bodhi, Claire, Crypt King, Daar, Daleson, Delcia, Demin, Drizzt, Elhan, Gaal, Garren, Ginia, Glaicus, Gythianki, Irenicus, Khan Zahraa, Knight of Solamia, Lieutenant Aegisfield, Logan, Merella, Miranda, Neb, Pa'Nai, Raelis, Renal Bloodscalp, Rose, Ryan Trawl, Rylock, Saemon Haevarian, Salvanas, Samia, Shark King, Sime, Sir Sarles, Svirfneblin Leader, Tarnor, Tirdir, Tiris, Tolgerias, Umar kids, Wellyn.</li>

		<hr style="width: 90%; "/><br>

		<p>
			Never forget:
			<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
				<li><strong>Watcher's keep is hidden in SoA</strong> (<ins>this is not a bug</ins>).</li>
				<li>Some of you may want to cheat: changing equipment, adding a bit of XP... may be fine. Once you reach the fundamentals of this mod (alignment and variables), you will find bugs beyond my control...<br>
				Another cheat example: you can try to have only Zaiya or Kiara in the game. There are so many cross variables in Kiara-Zaiya (including Kiara's AI script) that using CLUAConsole or ShadowKeeper and cheat will result in bugs everywhere! That includes changing fundamental variables for your characters like alignment and such.<br>
				<span style="color: #781808;"><strong>&#9755;</strong></span> DO NOT TRY and then tell me you found a bug!!!</li>

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please install Kiara-Zaiya after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, and EET.</li>

		<h2>Installation</h2><br>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-kiara-zaiya.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; kiara-zaiya folder.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old save games. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Kiara-Zaiya for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; kiara-zaiya folder and a setup-kiara-zaiya.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-kiara-zaiya.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-kiara-zaiya.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Mac OS</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Kiara-Zaiya for Mac OS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, extract the files of the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; kiara-zaiya folder, setup-kiara-zaiya and setup-kiara-zaiya.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-kiara-zaiya.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-kiara-zaiya.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Kiara-Zaiya for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;weinstall setup-kiara-zaiya&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine bgmain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> (or <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine baldur.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> for EE games), and start playing.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-kiara-zaiya --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

She started secretly studying it from the mage's book collection, although he prohibited such learning. During one of her reading, she contracted her affliction and despite numerous attempts never truly found a cure. She will no say more.</td>

			  When asked about her past, <span style="color: #781808;"><strong>Kiara</strong></span> tells you that she was born in the Kara Turian land of Koryo, far east of Faerûn. After the tragic death of her parents, she was rescued by a local monastery and although extremely rare for a girl, raised as a monk. She spent most of her youth there and learnt some basic fighting skills, herbal preparations and meditation. For an obscure reason, although from the tear in her eye you guess a tragic event, she was expelled from the monastery at an early age. She traveled to the west and met some merchants along the road which she escorted first to Tu Lung before embarking aboard a ship to the city of Medina al Afyal. This is an adventure she highly speaks of with an enthusiastic tone in her voice. On arrival at Afyal, she mentions she met Zaiya before being abducted by corsairs and sold as slaves in Athkatla. You see her face darken under her monk's hood; you know she will say no more.</td>

			<li>10th Level: <span style="color: #781808;">Snake Stance</span> (modified improved haste modified: attacks are doubled minus one, up to a maximum of 7 attacks per round at level 18+).

		<p>
			<strong>Other Special ability on occasion</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<span style="color: #781808;">Dragon Stance</span>: with this spell, Kiara acquires for a short time some of the dragon's innate strength and resistances.

			<strong>Notes on flirting with Kiara and enabling her battle script</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<span style="color: #781808;"><strong>&#9755;</strong></span> Talk to her to enable her battle script or flirt with her:
		</p><br>
		<ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li><span style="color: #781808;">Enable</span>: &quot;<em>Kiara, time to show us your fighting skills.</em>&quot;</li>
			<li><span style="color: #781808;">Fix battle by resetting the timer</span>: &quot;<em>What's wrong with your fighting skills, Kiara?</em>&quot;</li>
			<li><span style="color: #781808;">Disable</span> (set as default): &quot;<em>Kiara, let me direct you in the incoming battles.</em>&quot;</li>
			<li><span style="color: #781808;">Start Flirting</span>: Flirt with Kiara (only from love talk 2 to love talk 36).</li>
		</ol><br><br>

		<h3>Kiara Custom AI (Battle script)</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<strong>What does the Battle script actually do?</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			At high level, Kiara can clear out an entire area without your assistance with the script ON. She is quite slow at the start of the game but becomes a dervish of destruction by level 18!</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Risk assessment instructions have been included that prevent Kiara using all of her spells and abilities against low level enemies (gibberlings, kobolds, Ankheg...), she will only activate Stunning Blow against such foes! Don't expect her to use Solar Stance on gibberlings.<br>
			For all other enemies, the script works on a timer and will activate every round a new ability (IF she has the ability memorized AND the condition for its release is met!):
		</p>
		<p>
			The battle is automatically disabled if Kiara detects a high level mage alone (example Lich) protected from magic weapons (improved mantle, protection from magical, absolute immunity...), she does not see or detect any other enemy and she does not have Dragon Fist. Kiara was uselessly wasting her spells on various Lich found in the game.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; WARNING 1: The script (IF ACTIVATED) messes up in several occasions:
		</p><br>
		<ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>You cast a spell (e.g. Hardiness) just prior engaging a battle/seeing an enemy. The timer will be messed up! She will stay idle since the timer expired but she can't cast her ability yet! Once she casts the spell, the timer is still ahead and she again waits, despite the fact that the timer is set after &quot;cast the spell&quot; instruction!</li>
			<li>You have her use a potion or make her cast a spell during a battle! This will also mess up the timer, resulting in the same problem.</li>
			<li>She messes up by herself in some *rare* occasions. One example: she just casted a spell, last enemy dead (combat is over) but then suddenly an enemy spawns, the timer gets messed up!</li>
		</ol><br>
		<p>
			<span style="color: #781808;"><strong>&#9755;</strong></span> SOLUTION: Talk to her and ask her &quot;<em>What's wrong with your fighting skills, Kiara?</em>&quot; This will reset the timer and everything should be fine.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; WARNING 2: The battle script, <em>even if disabled</em>, will still activate some abilities or spells from time to time:
		</p><br>
		<ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>If Kiara sees a high level mage (e.g. Lich, Irenicus...) and her magic resistance is below 75%: Shadow Stance! Enemy can not target invisible creatures.</li>
			<li>If she has very few hit points left, she will use monk heal or a potion then re-engage battle. After that, if she has still or again few hit points left, she will cast shadow stance and leave the combat area until half hit points restored, using potions to speed up recovery. When almost half hit points restored, she will return to the battlefield and if any enemy left, activate her battle script whether ON initially or not...</li>
			<li>Enemy is invisible/hiding: cast true seeing if she acquired the second robe.</li>
		</ol><br><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px; border: 0;" /><br>


		<p>
			<strong>How do I best use the script?</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			The battle script is better reserved for hard battles since she will use all of her most powerful spells first in a very short time. On some very long battles in ToB, Sendai and Melissan, it will be useless.
		</p>
		<p>
			On a general note, DO NOT INTERFERE with the script, except directing her to a specific foe to attack or forcing an attack.
			<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
				<li>If you want somebody in particular to be attacked first (e.g. Drizzt), first move Kiara close to the enemy to attack, then attack. If no orders are given or she sees a closer enemy than the one directed, she will attack her nearest enemy.</li>
				<li>DO NOT force any abilities or make her use potions if you have the battle script on! This will disrupt the timer and she may stand idle for a while, refusing orders to attack. If you did, see above Warning 1. This is the only recovery possible. The timers are re-set when the battle is over or she is self healing but it will not be reset during a fight.</li>
				<li>Sometimes, she may seem to stand idle (one or two second max), <strong>do not interfere except to force an attack on an enemy</strong>, an ability will be cast soon and she will resume her attacks.</li>
				<li>For those who are on difficulty Insane, she casts Hardiness as contingency as from level 20 if you have the spell memorized (you need to select the spell only once from the special abilities).</li>
			</ul>
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px; border: 0;" /><br>


		<p>
			<strong>Brief overview of the script tactics.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			It is based on simple principles:
			<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
				<li>First disable your enemies if they are in a group (War Cry, Solar Stance),</li>
				<li>if your enemy has protections then disable his protections (Dragon Fist),</li>
				<li>then check your health and use Lay on Hands or potions if below 50%, </li>
				<li>then use the most powerful abilities to kill your enemies.</li>
				<li>Last and if severely taxed, go and hide using either Shadow Stance or a Potion of Invisibility, then wait using potions to heal before returning to the main character and engage combat again if enemies are around!</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<div class="important">
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;"><strong>A. Preparation spells (First one spell goes off from the following list):</strong>
		</p><br>
		  <ul>
			<li>Solar Stance: if see group of enemy and they are in range of Solar Stance.</li>
			<li>War Cry: if group of enemy in range with level &lt; 9.</li>
			<li>Dragon fist (HLA): if her nearest enemy has protections (magic weapons, stoneskins, spell turning...).</li>
			<li>Shadowless Kick: victim rendered unconscious - no save against this spell!</li>
			<li>Snake Stance: doubles attacks per round minus one for 6 rounds (1 turn).</li>
			<li>Solar Stance: if see group of enemy and they are in range of Solar Stance.</li>
			<li>Greater DeathBlow: enemy level &le; 12.</li>
			<li>DeathBlow: enemy level &le; 8.</li>
			<li>Quivering Palm: if enemy save vs spell is &ge; 8.</li>
			<li>Dragon Stance: sets strength at 25 for three round, critical strike in the first round, 25% resistance to slashing...</li>
			<li>Smite or (Tiger Strike): critical strike in the first round, with enemy rendered unconscious and blown back if save failed.</li>
			<li>Critical Strike: all hits are critical hits.</li>
			<li>Quivering Palm: if enemy save vs spell is &lt; 8.</li>
			<li>Stunning Blow: enemy stunned if failed his saving throw.</li>
			<li>Power Attack: same as Stunning Blow.</li>
		  </ul>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;"><strong>B. After the preparation spells, conditional spells are first activated if the condition is met every round (6 seconds real time):</strong>
		</p><br>
		  <ul>
			<li>Chant: if HP less than 66% (60% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing... for 3 rounds).</li>
			<li>Lay on Hands: hit points less than 50% and amounts of Lay on Hands is over 27.</li>
			<li>Use a healing potion: hit points less than 50%; does not have Lay on Hands.</li>
			<li>Lay on Hands: hit points less than 50% and amounts of Lay on Hands is below 27.</li>
			<li>Solar Stance: if see a group of enemy with level &ge; 9.</li>
			<li>War Cry: group of enemy level &le; 9.</li>
			<li>Dragon fist: if her nearest enemy has protections (magic_weapons, stoneskins, spell turning...).</li>
			<li>Greater DeathBlow: enemy level &le; 12.</li>
			<li>DeathBlow: enemy level &le; 8.</li>
		  </ul>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;"><strong>C. Then all other spells activate every round (6 seconds real time):</strong>
		</p><br>
		  <ul>
			<li>Shadowless Kick.</li>
			<li>Snake Stance.</li>
			<li>Quivering palm: if enemy save vs spell is above 5.</li>
			<li>Dragon Stance.</li>
			<li>Quivering Palm: if enemy save vs spell is below 5.</li>
			<li>Smite (1 round later).</li>
			<li>Critical Strike (1 round later).</li>
			<li>Stunning blow (2 rounds later until exhausted).</li>
			<li>Power attack (2 rounds later until exhausted).</li>
		  </ul><br>
		</div><br>

		<p>
			If she has all spells (condition met), she will cast all the spells, or skip to the next available spell.
		</p>

		<p>
			&#10173; THE SCRIPT MIGHT STILL BE IMPROVED DRASTICALLY BY DIFFERENTIATING THE TYPE OF CREATURES OR GROUP OF CREATURES FACED ESPECIALLY AT HIGH LEVEL, BUT I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO DO SO.

		<h2>Components</h2><br>

		<p>
			As of v2.0.0, the installer offers two main sub-components, letting the players decide which one they want to install.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p><strong>[0-1] Kiara-Zaiya for BG2</strong> (Main component)
		</p>
		  <ul style="margin-left: 4%;"><strong>
			[0] Kiara-Zaiya for BG2 with vanilla soundsets<br>
			[1] Kiara-Zaiya for BG2 with custom soundsets (English only)</strong><br>
		  </ul>

		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This is the main component that adds Kiara and Zaiya to the game.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p><strong>[2] Alternate Monk High level abilities by TG Maestro</strong>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This optional component modifies the original Monk High level abilities.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;">
			The HLA are the High Level Abilities. This set replaces the Monk's selection of spells from the fighter pool abilities to a complete different set. You can read it from Kiara's spell folder &quot;description.txt&quot;. I would definitely try it as Kiara will have far more interesting spells like Dragon Fist, capable of removing a mage's protections (yes everything from spell trap to protection from magic weapons!).<br>
			Well if you tested Kish's excellent Monk HLA, you may want to leave it. This one is perhaps more balanced (e.g. no Lunar Stance) and fewer Balthazar spells but others instead (Chant, Evasion and Greater Evasion which are rogue HLA).
		</p>
		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; <ins>Note from the maintainers</ins>: this component overwrites the original monk HLA table, and therefore may conflict with other mods involving monk NPCs or IA scripting. This outdated way of coding is maybe the worst modding practice ever made. The best way to fix it would be to create a custom kit for Kiara. Unless many players request it, spending hours to produce it would be a waste of time. Thus, unless you really want to play it, we strongly recommend not to install it.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p>
			The following components increase a few encounters difficulties and are not needed by the main plot.
		</p>
		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; DO NOT INSTALL THEM IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TACTICS MOD AND THE LIKE. Moreover, these very old components were coded long before the release of Stratagems which is a better alternative.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p><strong>[3] Original Amaralis battles in chapters 2 and 6</strong>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This optional component makes Amaralis encounter tougher.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;">
			First you will find a less cheesy opponent in chapter 2. He will still use low spells BUT a few more well chosen ones and will use &quot;Improved Haste&quot; instead of just &quot;Haste&quot;. But then don't forget he is master slaver of Akhlata, something of the kind was to be expected!<br>
			In chapter 6, you will find four more deadly opponents in Amaralis's party (A mage, a druid, a second berserker yielding Soul Reaver and a elven ranger with a long bow and poison arrows). You are ill advised to try this fight unless you are familiar with tactics and the likes! The standard Amaralis Chapter 6 fight is hard enough.<br>
			This option was developed in the spirit of Ascension and Tactics.<br>
			&#9888;&#65039; Do not install the improved Amaralis fight unless you are familiar with Tactics. You will find it impossible! They all have higher levels than you and use it quite well.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p><strong>[4] Tougher Kiara vampire</strong> (only for classic games)
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This optional component makes Kiara turned into a vampire by Bodhi tougher.
		</p>
		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; Dealing with vampires in EE games needs to be re-examined due to the changes made after Hexxat. Instead of updating it, we decided to make it unavailable for EE games. &#128521;
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>


		<p><strong>[5] Revised Suldalanessar</strong>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This optional component makes Suldalanessar Demon tougher.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;">
			SULDALANESSAR'S DEMON IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL WITHOUT THE CORRECT TACTICS AND CAN BE FRUSTRATING AS EVEN THEN HE MIGHT STILL KILL YOU!
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>


		<p><strong>[6] Jao and party for SoA: another tough fight</strong>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This optional component makes this encounter tougher.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;">
			JAO DOES NOT TAKE DAMAGE. NO! IT'S NOT A BUG. ON PURPOSE AND IT IS FRUSTRATING TOO.

		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>


		<p><strong>[7] Tougher Irenicus at the Tree of life</strong>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top:1%;">
			<span style="color: #781808;">&#10173;</span> This optional component makes this fight tougher.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 1%;">
			JON IRENICUS SUMMONS A LOT (WELL THINK IT'S PART OF HIS NEWLY ACQUIRED BHAALSPAWN POWERS... I NEVER LIKED THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE SLAYER. IT'S TOO EASY FOR A 20TH LEVEL PARTY.). HE IS VERY TOUGH BUT EASIER THAN THE DEMON.

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: What kind of new fights were added to SoA?</strong><br>
			A: Several.<br>
			<ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
				<li>Poisonous Wyvern: two scrolls of Protection from poison are supplied, use them. &#128578; They might not be enough though &#128521; and you might want a cleric to cast Dispel Invisibility (3rd level spell) and Zaiya to cast Breach.</li>
				<li>Amaralis first fight (Chapter 2): Amaralis is a Male Kensai/Mage (Level 9/13). This one has been reduced so any party can easily do it.</li>
				<li>Amaralis (and his goons) second fight (chapter 6): Amaralis is still a Male Kensai/Mage (Level increased to 13/15) and Hroth'Kar is a Male Half Orc Barbarian (level 20).<br>
				Notes: To reduce the number of opponents set the game's difficulty level to EASIEST and the barbarian will not appear.<br>
				Beware that the fight is very difficult and leaving the area or trying to hide won't work! There are several tactics that will work on him.<br>
				&#9888;&#65039; Do not install the improved Amaralis fight unless you are familiar with tactics. You will find it impossible! They all have higher levels than you and use it quite well.</li>

			<strong>Q: How many quests do I need to do before leaving for Brynnlaw?</strong><br>
			A: Two. First De Arnise Keep, then do either Firkraag, Planar Sphere or the ransom quest from the Graveyard District.<br>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: How do I defeat Amaralis the first time?</strong><br>
			A: Use potions, buy a Rod of Resurrection and use it to resurrect some of your dead fighters. Alternatively, use a Monster Summoning spell or wand to create additional allies and lure Amaralis away from your fighters.<br>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: Kiara has been abducted by Bodhi and turned into a vampire. How do I get her back?</strong><br>
			A: Like any other romance character (Anomen, Aerie, Viconia, Jaheira) in BGII abducted by Bodhi.<br>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: What happened to Amaralis? Where is the long promised second fight?</strong><br>
			A: Check the Small Teeth Pass area.<br>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: The second fight with Amaralis is hard, how do I defeat him and his goons?</strong><br>
			A: By selecting EASY, you get to fight Amaralis only. Don't expect to arrive and win on the first run!<br>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: Is it possible to get a good Kiara in the end?</strong><br>
			A: Yes. Though, she will be extremely hard to get. Only those who search Amn thoroughly, keep the romance going on *<em>may</em>* get a good Kiara and are lucky... may get a good Kiara.<br>

			<li>Artwork: Portrait of Kiara by Amalthea (The sketch is truly great work and I can't wait for final portrait). The other portraits provided are mine and *please* should not be used with another mod, they are Kiara-Zaiya.</li>
			<li>Kiara voicing: A special thank to Sorschana. Her voice and acting are just awesome. I can't think of anything else that integrates so well in BGII. Well, she sure has a BIG fan of her work!</li>
			<li>Zaiya voicing: Thanks to Domi. Her accent is going to bring an exotic touch to Zaiya. Besides, her acting is very good too!</li>
			<li>Beta testing: Amongst testers, I'd like to thank particularly Castamir (Mike) for his trial of the mod which hopefully led to the killing of all undesired bugs in the game. I'm being hopeful here, it would be faster with a spray! &#128578;</li>
			<li>HLA and Kiara balancing: My thanks to T.G. Maestro for his valuable insight in reducing Kiara's Strength from initially Balthazar to &quot;<em>Hey! Why did she die for?&quot;</em> &#128578; Joking aside, he has contributed to make the game more fun. Besides, Kiara will also use most of his own spells and his own HLA table when she reaches level 20. You won't see much before ToB but it will give you an idea.</li>
			<li>Detectable Spells: I would like to thank Cirerrek for letting me use this very good mod in Kiara-Zaiya, and of course it's original developers Kensai Ryu and Vulgar Zildrah. It has been extremely helpful in improving the battles in Kiara-Zaiya.</li>
			<li>Thot started the French translation lazy as I am. &#128521; Thanks Thot! The translation was achieved by Elgaern, Bloody.Mary and Lothringen (des d'Oghmatiques).</li>
			<li>Chlo&eacute; has agreed doing the German translation. My German is a bit too rusty for such large endeavour in German. So, thanks Chlo&eacute;.</li>
			<li>Jason Campton: first for letting me use part of his code. I did not give him much choice I must say. &#128578; and secondly for is pertinent advice regarding my old coding.</li>
			<li>Wes Weimer and <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>: I long wondered if I should curse the man or kiss his feet? &#128541; I guess a bit of both. &#128514;<br>
			I'll explain: I guess the &quot;parse error...&quot; *is* every modder's nightmare and I got my fair share of it, that said I can't think of a better program to bring the mods out to you once you get the hang of it!<br>
			I wouldn't have even started modding without it. So, a BIG thank to Wes.</li>
			<li>CamDawg for letting us &quot;borrow&quot; pieces of code from the Fixpack.</li>
			<li>Story additional research: Thanks to Mikka, I closely avoided the mention AU (Alternate Universe) and her help was useful in making a credible story within Toril.</li>
			<li>Other help: I would like to thank everybody who left a message on the Kiara-Zaiya forum at FWS and their valuable support and/or help towards this mod.</li>
			<li>Last but not least, Bioware and their team for making such a great game!</li>
