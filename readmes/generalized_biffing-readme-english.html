		<h2>Overview</h2><br>

		<p>
			This <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. This works natively under OSX and Linux (if you use the correct executable) and is compatible with the common WeiDU stack un-install operation. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> Recent user reports have indicated that Generalized Biffing is unnecessary for Enhanced Edition games.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; <strong>Warning: Waiting for next WeiDU update, please install this mod with <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases/tag/v246.00">WeiDU v.246</a>.</strong>

		<h2>Installation</h2><br>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-generalized_biffing.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; generalized_biffing folder.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Generalized Biffing for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; generalized_biffing folder and a setup-generalized_biffing.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-generalized_biffing.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-generalized_biffing.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Mac OS</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Generalized Biffing for Mac OS distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; generalized_biffing folder, setup-generalized_biffing and setup-generalized_biffing.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-generalized_biffing.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-generalized_biffing.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Generalized Biffing for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;WeInstall setup-generalized_biffing&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine BGMain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>  (or <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine baldur.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> for EE games), and start playing.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-generalized_biffing --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

		<h2>Components</h2><br>

		<p>As of v2.3, the installer splits main component into two sub components, letting the player decide if he wants to biff all files or only .wav, .tis and .bam files.</p>
		<p>The number of each is the component <span class="tp2">DESIGNATED</span> number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components and mods detect it and allows automated installers to specify component choices.</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p><strong>[0] Biff only .wav, .tis and .bam files.</strong><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			&#10173; This component might be enough for installations with few mods (recommended by The Bigg and other "<em>Small World Dudes</em>").
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<p><strong>[1] Biff all files.</strong><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			&#10173; This component is recommended by the "<em>Big World Dudes</em>" (practically essential for installations with many mods).

          <h2>Troubleshooting</h2><br>

		<p>
			These are some general tips if you have problems getting the game working, with or without this or other mods. Many times, errors have to do with the game engine itself or the manner of installation or gameplay. The game recommends deleting all files out of the /cache, /temp and /tempsave &#x1F4C1; sub-folders in your game folder to see if that resolves the problem before any further troubleshooting.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Symptom: Game freezes or crashes to desktop (CTDs)</strong>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Sometimes the game displays an "assertion error" in a pop-up window when this happens, but often times it doesn't. To enable the full error message, open the file <strong>baldur.ini</strong> in your game folder with a text editor (such as Notepad). If you find you can't edit it or save changes in Windows Vista or 7, see <a href="http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.html?topic=662080&forum=10">this topic</a> for assistance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the [Program Options] section in the file, type <strong>Logging On=1</strong> (unless it's already there). While you're there, you may also want to make sure <strong>Debug Mode=1</strong> is there to enable the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/appendices/clua/bg2.htm">CLUA Console</a> for debugging and testing. Save the file and exit. Now go back into the game and try to reproduce the crash. Then look in your game folder again for the <strong>Baldur.err</strong> file and open it with a text editor to analyse its contents.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Symptom: Game crashes with no Baldur.err log and shows either a black screen or a pop-up window indicating an error at offset 005ca8a8</strong>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			This usually indicates an animation-related issue. Make sure you have the latest version of the mod. If you've installed other mods after it and have this issue, install the fix available <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/884-ia-aurora-low-fix/">here</a>.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Symptom:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="important" style="background-color: black;color: #deded9;">
			<p style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;">
				<strong>ERROR: error copying [infinityanimations/content/somefile.bam]<br>
				ERROR: [SOMEFILE.CRE] -> [override/SOMEFILE.CRE] Patching failed (COPY)<br>
				Stopping installation because of error.</strong> (with no other error message)<br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Less-than-informative messages like these may indicate you're installing to a hard drive with a low data transfer rate or an antivirus program is active during installation (which can also affect data transfer). Try installing to an internal drive with antivirus protection disabled during the install. If unsure, disconnect from the Internet (either unplug your network cable or disable your wireless adaptor) and turn off <strong>all</strong> memory-resident programs during the install. To get a list of these, go to Start > Run and type <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;msconfig&nbsp;</span></strong> where it says "<em>Open:</em>" then click OK. When the System Configuration Utility appears, click on the Startup tab. The only really necessary programs that need to be loaded in memory at startup are those related to your graphics chip (typically ATI or NVIDIA). Uncheck everything else, reboot and try installing the mod again. There are well-documented issues with installing mods while Avast antivirus is running, so make absolutely sure all components of Avast are completely disabled.
