                <h2>Overview</h2><br>

                <p>
                    This game mod (modification or module) is created for the BG2:SoA side of a BG2:ToB game (yes,
                    BG2:ToB is required), as many people wouldn't want to go through a whole new game to reach ToB areas
                    just to play this mod. With that in mind, most people who have played BG2 know that one of the plot
                    quests is to save the village/town of Trademeet from evil druids, Calim rakshasa, and the noble
                    bickerings. "<em>Shadows Over Soubar</em>" picks up just after that. However, action in the mod does
                    occur if you do not complete the entire sequence of quests in Trademeet, beginning directly after
                    Imoen is kidnapped by the Cowls and Irenicus.
                </p>

                                We know that war is brewing in Tethyr, and that the Sword Coast has experienced troubles
                                since our hero left Candlekeep as a young adventurer. Power groups- the Iron Throne in
                                particular- have been destroyed, and others are quick to grab for their own power.
                                Including such enemies as Yaga-Sura, Melissan, and Irenicus. But there are other less
                                twisted enemies that prey not on heroes, but on the simple folk. Folk who's only crime
                                is that they live in a town where a great leader who met an orcan horde on the field of
                                battle once lived. Farmers, herders, tradesmen, and merchants all are affected by those
                                who claim power over their lives. Now that sounds like a call for help! Which our great
                                hero will answer. To the rescue we go!
                            </p>
                            <p style="width:96%; color:#5f5f5f;">
                                So our story begins in Trademeet, where our hero learns that some mysterious men from
                                the north are looking for them. What those men want, we are not sure. But after a time
                                of searching Amn, our great hero finds a sneaky thief who '<em>employs</em>' us to do
                                some '<em>work</em>'. After completing the jobs, the sneaky thief will finally tell our
                                hero what needs to be done to move on. And our hero does indeed move on, finding some
                                letters which leads them to the mysterious men. These mysterious men will explain the
                                entire situation, and the hero can accept (continue the mod) or decline to help.

                    <em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; mymod folder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Console application like Command Prompt, Windows Terminal, macos Terminal, Linux Shell etc">Console</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly Avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

                    Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2><br>

                <p>
                    These are some general tips if you have problems getting the game working, with or without this or other mods. Many times, errors have to do with the game engine itself or the manner of installation or gameplay. The game recommends deleting all files out of the /cache, /temp and /tempsave &#x1F4C1; sub-folders in your game folder to see if that resolves the problem before any further troubleshooting.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%;" /><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Symptom: Game freezes or crashes to desktop (CTDs)</strong>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the game displays an "assertion error" in a pop-up window when this happens, but often times it doesn't. To enable the full error message, open the file <strong>baldur.ini</strong> in your game folder with a text editor (such as Notepad). If you find you can't edit it or save changes in Windows Vista or 7, see <a href="http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.html?topic=662080&forum=10">this topic</a> for assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the [Program Options] section in the file, type <strong>Logging On=1</strong> (unless it's already there). While you're there, you may also want to make sure <strong>Debug Mode=1</strong> is there to enable the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/appendices/clua/bg2.htm">CLUA Console</a> for debugging and testing. Save the file and exit. Now go back into the game and try to reproduce the crash. Then look in your game folder again for the <strong>Baldur.err</strong> file and open it with a text editor to analyse its contents.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%;" /><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Symptom: Game crashes with no Baldur.err log and shows either a black screen or a pop-up window indicating an error at offset 005ca8a8</strong>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    This usually indicates an animation-related issue. Make sure you have the latest version of the mod. If you've installed other mods after it and have this issue, install the fix available <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/884-ia-aurora-low-fix/">here</a>.

                <p>
                    Less-than-informative messages like these may indicate you're installing to a hard drive with a low data transfer rate or an antivirus program is active during installation (which can also affect data transfer). Try installing to an internal drive with antivirus protection disabled during the install. If unsure, disconnect from the Internet (either unplug your network cable or disable your wireless adaptor) and turn off <strong>all</strong> memory-resident programs during the install. To get a list of these, go to Start > Run and type <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;msconfig&nbsp;</span></strong> where it says "<em>Open:</em>" then click OK. When the System Configuration Utility appears, click on the Startup tab. The only really necessary programs that need to be loaded in memory at startup are those related to your graphics chip (typically ATI or NVIDIA). Uncheck everything else, reboot and try installing the mod again. There are well-documented issues with installing mods while Avast antivirus is running, so make absolutely sure all components of Avast are completely disabled.

                <p>
                    If none of this resolves your issue, or you have mod-specific issues, please report the problem in the mod's <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/">forum</a>.

                    The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for more than 10 years now, and
                    is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce
                    their best work and players get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's work as your own. The
                    second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission from the author(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either.
